If you want to work on anything together, don't be afraid to reach my me at alexnorton@vt.edu

Currently, I am a master's student at Virginia Tech studying Computer Science. 

I am interested in software development, machine learning, and AI.

I enjoy running, building community and side projects when I have the time.
